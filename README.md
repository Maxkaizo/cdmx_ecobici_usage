# üö¥ Ecobici Data Pipeline

This project showcases the development of a complete batch data pipeline using open data from Ecobici CDMX. The main goal is to demonstrate end-to-end capabilities in orchestration, ingestion, modeling, and data visualization in the cloud, rather than performing deep analytical insights on the dataset itself.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure

The pipeline leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services:

- üìÅ GCS (Google Cloud Storage): acts as the Data Lake
- üßÆ BigQuery: for data ingestion and transformation
- üìä Looker Studio: for final data visualization
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Terraform**: used to provision all cloud infrastructure components

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** In a real-world production setting, Kestra would typically run in the cloud (via Kubernetes or a VM).  
> In this project, **Kestra is executed locally** to orchestrate the pipeline while minimizing cloud costs.  
> All data infrastructure lives in the cloud and is fully managed via Terraform for scalability and reproducibility.

## üß© Pipeline Components

| Stage                 | Tool              | Description                                                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orchestration         | Kestra            | Locally running orchestrator triggering each batch pipeline step             |
| Data Lake             | Google Cloud Storage | Stores raw monthly files from Ecobici                                        |
| Ingestion to DWH      | BigQuery          | Loads GCS files into intermediate staging tables                             |
| Transformations       | dbt               | Transforms staging tables into joined models, containerized and orchestrated |
| Visualization         | Looker Studio     | Dashboard with at least 2 visual insights                                     |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

```bash
# 1. Initialize and apply Terraform
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply

# 2. Run the pipeline with Kestra CLI
cd kestra/
kestra start

# 3. Explore the data in BigQuery
# 4. Open the dashboard in Looker Studio
